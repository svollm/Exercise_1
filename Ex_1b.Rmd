## Exercise 1. b)-3

Create an HTML document that samples 100 values from a log-normal distribution (say, mu=1, sigma=.25); create a histogram of the distribution and the distribution on the log scale; report the mean and variance of the sample in line in the text. In general, do not just dump the R code and plots in the HTML document; break your exercises into sections with headings, add some text and make it readable.

#Code

```{r}
set.seed(10)
data <- rlnorm(n=100,   meanlog = 1,sdlog = .25)
hist(data,main = "Histogram of simulated data")
hist(log(data),main = "Histogram of simulated data on log scale")
mean_data <- mean(data)
var_data <- var(data)
```

# Results

The mean of the simulated data is `r mean_data`, the variance is `r var_data`.
